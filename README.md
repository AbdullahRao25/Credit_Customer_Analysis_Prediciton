# Credit Customer Analysis & Prediction

This project is a comprehensive end-to-end analysis and prediction pipeline for credit card customer behavior. It combines **data analysis**, **SQL querying**, **machine learning modeling**, and **Power BI visualizations** to derive actionable insights and predict customer responses based on credit usage data.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to:
- Understand credit card customer behavior through data analysis.
- Segment customers based on usage and demographics.
- Build predictive models to forecast customer responses.
- Create an interactive dashboard to communicate insights effectively.
